- ✅ Enhanced verification section with automated testing
- ✅ Updated support section with CLI diagnostic commands

## Verified CLI Functionality

### Server Management
```bash
srrd serve start     # ✅ Starts server, handles Ctrl+C gracefully
srrd serve stop      # ✅ Stops server cleanly
srrd serve restart   # ✅ Restarts server
```

### Configuration & Status
```bash
srrd configure --status  # ✅ Shows detailed status with actionable tips
srrd --help             # ✅ Shows all available commands
srrd serve --help       # ✅ Shows server management options
```

### Process Detection
- ✅ Accurate PID-based server detection
- ✅ Proper cleanup of stale tracking files
- ✅ User-friendly status messages with next steps

### Configuration Detection
- ✅ Claude Desktop configuration detection
- ✅ VS Code configuration detection
- ✅ Helpful tips for using configured clients

## Testing Workflow

The setup script now includes:
1. CLI package installation via `pip install -e .`
2. CLI command testing (`srrd --help`, `srrd configure --status`)
3. MCP server testing (existing functionality)
4. LaTeX testing (existing functionality)
5. Clear guidance on CLI usage

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Port-based detection (unreliable)
- "Server not responding" errors
- Manual configuration required
- No CLI management tools

### After
- PID-based detection (accurate)
- Clear status messages with tips
- Automated configuration
- Full CLI suite for server management
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling

## Documentation Updates

All documentation now reflects:
- Automated setup as the primary installation method
- CLI commands for server management
- Troubleshooting with CLI diagnostic tools
- Enhanced user guidance with actionable tips

## ✅ **FINAL STATUS: Redesigned CLI Architecture**

The CLI now properly implements the planned schema:

### **Infrastructure Setup** ✅
```bash
srrd init [--domain physics|cs|bio|general] [--template minimal|standard|full]
```
- Creates scientific collaboration structure
- Sets up work/ vs publications/ separation  
- Generates project README and .gitignore
- Initializes MCP configuration and knowledge base

### **Build Automation** ✅  
```bash
srrd generate pdf [file.tex] [--output DIR]
srrd generate template [proposal|paper|thesis] --title "Title" [--output work/drafts/]
```
- Compiles LaTeX with proper bibliography handling
- Creates basic LaTeX templates (no AI content)
- Places templates in work/drafts/ for MCP to enhance

### **Publication Workflow** ✅
```bash
srrd publish [draft-name] [--version v1.0] [--force]
```
- Moves finalized work from work/drafts/ to publications/
- Updates root README with publication info
- Creates Git tags for versions
- Compiles final PDFs

### **Project Management** ✅
```bash
srrd status         # Show project structure health
srrd serve start    # Start MCP server  
srrd configure      # Configure IDE integration
```

### **Clear Separation Achieved:**
- **CLI**: Infrastructure, build automation, publication workflow
- **MCP**: AI-guided content creation, research assistance, semantic search
- **Integration**: CLI creates structure that MCP uses, CLI processes MCP outputs

The project now has a coherent architecture where CLI and MCP complement rather than duplicate each other.
