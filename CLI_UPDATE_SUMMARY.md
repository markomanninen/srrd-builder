## Testing Workflow

The setup script now includes:
1. CLI package installation via `pip install -e .`
2. CLI command testing (`srrd --help`, `srrd configure --status`)
3. MCP server testing (existing functionality)
4. LaTeX testing (existing functionality)
5. Clear guidance on CLI usage

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Port-based detection (unreliable)
- "Server not responding" errors
- Manual configuration required
- No CLI management tools

### After
- PID-based detection (accurate)
- Clear status messages with tips
- Automated configuration
- Full CLI suite for server management
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling

## Documentation Updates

All documentation now reflects:
- Automated setup as the primary installation method
- CLI commands for server management
- Troubleshooting with CLI diagnostic tools
- Enhanced user guidance with actionable tips

## Next Steps

The SRRD-Builder project now has:
- ✅ Robust CLI tool for server management
- ✅ Reliable setup and configuration process
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ User-friendly status reporting
- ✅ Proper signal handling

Users can now:
1. Run `./setup.sh` for complete automated installation
2. Use `srrd configure --status` to check everything
3. Use `srrd serve start/stop/restart` for server management
4. Get actionable guidance from status messages
5. Interrupt servers cleanly with Ctrl+C

The project is ready for production use with Claude Desktop and VS Code.
