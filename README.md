## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cross-Platform Issues

1. **Claude Desktop not finding tools**: Check configuration with `srrd configure --status` and ensure `claude_desktop_config.json` is properly set
2. **WebSocket demo server connection failed**: Ensure `srrd-server` is running and check port 8765 availability
3. **Web interface can't connect**: Make sure WebSocket server is running with `srrd-server --with-frontend`
4. **MCP server errors in Claude**: Check Python environment and dependencies, view logs in `work/code/mcp/logs/`
5. **LaTeX compilation errors**: Verify LaTeX installation with `pdflatex --version`
6. **Import errors**: Ensure virtual environment is activated

#### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- **"'srrd' is not recognized"**: Ensure virtual environment is activated with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
- **"Access denied" errors**: Run as Administrator or check antivirus software

**WSL:**
- **"$'\r': command not found"**: Run `dos2unix setup.sh` to fix line endings
- **"venv/bin/activate: No such file"**: Script will automatically detect and recreate Unix-style venv

**All Platforms:**
- **Virtual environment activation**: 
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
  - macOS/Linux/WSL: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Getting Help

1. **Run Test Suite**: `bash run_tests.sh` - Full validation (183/183 tests passing)
2. Check server status: `srrd configure --status`
3. View logs in `work/code/mcp/logs/`
4. Check the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) for platform-specific troubleshooting
