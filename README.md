# SRRD-Builder

**S**cientific **R**esearch **R**equirement **D**ocument Builder - A neurosymbolic (symbolic + LLM) tool for generating scientific research requirement documents with AI-driven research guidance.

## Overview

SRRD-Builder is designed to support the full scientific research lifecycle, from initial planning to publication-ready documents. It features special capabilities for novel theory development in fundamental physics, ensuring equal treatment and rigorous development of alternative paradigms.

The project provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that integrates with Claude Desktop and VS Code, offering 30+ research tools for document generation, knowledge management, and research quality assurance.

## Key Features

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** for interactive research guidance
- **CLI Tool (`srrd`)** for server management and configuration
- **30+ Research Tools** including document generation, semantic search, and quality gates
- **LaTeX Document Generation** with automatic bibliography integration
- **Vector Database Storage** for semantic search and knowledge management
- **Git-based Project Management** with session restoration
- **Socratic Questioning Engine** for progressive research refinement
- **Novel Theory Development Framework** for paradigm innovation in physics
- **Local Storage Integration** (Git, SQLite, Vector DB)

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Automated Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markomanninen/srrd-builder
cd srrd-builder
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install Python dependencies
- Install the `srrd` CLI tool
- Configure LaTeX (if needed)
- Set up Claude Desktop configuration
- Test all components

### üì± CLI Usage

After installation, use the `srrd` command-line tool:

```bash
# Check configuration and server status
srrd configure --status

# Start the MCP server
srrd serve start

# Stop the MCP server  
srrd serve stop

# Restart the MCP server
srrd serve restart

# Get help
srrd --help
```

### üîß Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- LaTeX distribution (MacTeX on macOS, TeXLive on Linux)
- Claude Desktop or VS Code with MCP support
- Git

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

1. Install using `./setup.sh`
2. Check status: `srrd configure --status`
3. Start server: `srrd serve start`
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Use SRRD-Builder tools in your conversations

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides 30+ tools organized by category:

- **Project Management**: Initialize projects, save/restore sessions
- **Research Planning**: Clarify goals, suggest methodologies, quality gates
- **Document Generation**: LaTeX compilation, bibliography management
- **Knowledge Management**: Semantic search, concept extraction, pattern discovery
- **Storage**: Vector database operations, document similarity
- **Quality Assurance**: Peer review simulation, research validation

### Example Workflow

```
# In Claude Desktop:
"Initialize a new research project on quantum computing"
"Generate a LaTeX document with bibliography from my vector database"
"Perform semantic search for related documents"
"Simulate peer review of my methodology section"
```
