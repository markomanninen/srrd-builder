### üì± Server Access Methods

SRRD-Builder provides two ways to access the MCP server:

#### 1. Project-Aware Server (`srrd serve`)
For use within SRRD projects with Claude Desktop/VS Code integration:

```bash
# Initialize a new research project
cd /path/to/your/git/repo
srrd init

# Start project-aware MCP server
srrd serve start

# Check configuration and server status
srrd configure --status

# Stop the MCP server  
srrd serve stop  
```

#### 2. Global WebSocket Server (`srrd-server`)
For demos, web interfaces, and external access:

```bash
# Start global WebSocket server only
srrd-server

# Start with web frontend interface
srrd-server --with-frontend

# Use custom ports
srrd-server --port 9000 --frontend-port 8080

# Get help
