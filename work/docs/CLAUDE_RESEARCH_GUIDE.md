- **Tool Usage Patterns**: Which tools you use most and when
- **Research Velocity**: How quickly you progress through phases
- **Quality Gates**: Whether you've met standards at each phase
- **Innovation Metrics**: How novel and impactful your research is

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For Each Research Act

1. **Conceptualization**: Take time to really clarify your goals - good research starts with clear questions
2. **Design & Planning**: Don't skip methodology validation - it saves time later
3. **Knowledge Acquisition**: Build your bibliography systematically as you go
4. **Analysis & Synthesis**: Use knowledge graphs to see connections you might miss
5. **Validation & Refinement**: Always simulate peer review before finalizing
6. **Communication**: Use templates and auto-bibliography for professional results

### Tool Selection Strategy

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Use conceptualization tools first, then get specific
- **Follow the workflow**: The research acts are designed to build on each other
- **Use tracking tools**: Regular progress checks keep you on track
- **Iterate**: Research is not linear - revisit earlier acts as needed

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Framework Works

This framework is based on actual academic research practices and addresses real challenges researchers face:

- **Information overload** â†’ Semantic search and knowledge graphs
- **Methodology uncertainty** â†’ Expert methodology recommendations  
- **Quality concerns** â†’ Automated peer review and quality gates
- **Writing challenges** â†’ Professional LaTeX generation with auto-bibliography
