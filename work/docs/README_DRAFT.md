# SRRD-Builder: Scientific Research Requirement Document Builder

## Overview

SRRD-Builder is an AI-driven tool that uses a neurosymbolic approach, combining traditional symbolic programming (rule-based systems, structured knowledge, logical reasoning) with neural networks/large language models to automatically generate comprehensive scientific research requirement documents. The system includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides interactive guidance through both research planning and execution phases, applying high-end research methodologies with Socratic questioning and collaborative ideation. The tool assists researchers, institutions, and AI systems in creating structured, methodologically sound research proposals and guides them through the complete research lifecycle to publication-ready documents.

## Core Objectives

1. **Automated Research Planning**: Generate detailed research requirement documents based on topic, methodology, and research type inputs
2. **Interactive MCP Server**: Provide real-time guidance through research planning and execution using Model Context Protocol
3. **Methodological Rigor**: Ensure generated documents follow established scientific research standards and best practices
4. **Socratic Guidance**: Interactive questioning system to clarify requirements and facilitate collaborative ideation
5. **Neurosymbolic AI Integration**: Facilitate AI-driven research by combining structured symbolic programming with neural AI capabilities
6. **Complete Research Lifecycle**: Guide from initial planning through publication-ready document generation
7. **Quality Assurance**: Implement validation mechanisms using both rule-based and AI-powered quality checks with peer review simulation
8. **Novel Theory Development**: Special emphasis on fundamental physics research that challenges existing paradigms, develops alternative ontologies, and rigorously investigates foundational ideas with equal treatment to mainstream approaches
9. **Critical Innovation Framework**: Systematic development of novel ideas from initial conception through rigorous presentation, ensuring alternative theories receive comprehensive development rather than dismissal
