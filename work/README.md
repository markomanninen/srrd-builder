# Work Directory

This directory contains all development and draft materials.

## Structure

- `drafts/` - Draft papers and manuscripts
- `research/` - Research notes, literature reviews, methodology
- `data/` - Datasets, experimental data, analysis scripts

## Workflow

1. Use Claude Desktop with SRRD-Builder to generate content in `drafts/`
2. Iterate and refine using MCP tools
3. When ready, use `srrd publish <draft-name>` to move to `publications/`

## Guidelines

- Keep drafts separate from final publications
- Use meaningful filenames (e.g., `quantum-computing-review.tex`)
- Commit regularly to track research progress
- Use MCP tools for content generation and quality assurance
