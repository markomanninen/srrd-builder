# User Interaction Intelligence and Context Analysis

## Overview

Enhance the SRRD-Builder MCP server to capture, analyze, and leverage detailed user interaction data beyond basic tool usage logging. This enhancement focuses on understanding the "why" and "how" behind tool usage through comprehensive user input analysis, enabling intelligent progress insights and personalized research guidance.

## Goals

- Capture detailed user input and interaction context for all MCP tools
- Analyze user research patterns, interests, and progression over time
- Generate insights about research focus evolution and decision-making patterns
- Enable personalized recommendations based on user's research style and preferences
- Create rich contextual data for enhanced progress reports and milestone tracking

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Logging Infrastructure

**Current tool usage logging** (`work/code/mcp/storage/sqlite_manager.py`):
```sql
CREATE TABLE tool_usage (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    tool_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    result_summary TEXT,
    session_id VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Existing interactions table** (`work/code/mcp/models/interaction.py`):
```sql  
CREATE TABLE interactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    interaction_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    user_input TEXT,
    ai_response TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    metadata TEXT
);
```

### Gap Analysis

**What's Missing:**
- User input parameters are not systematically captured
- No analysis of user's research interests and focus areas
- Limited context about user's decision-making process
- No tracking of user's knowledge evolution
- Missing semantic analysis of user inputs
- No correlation between user inputs and research outcomes
